        <h2>Behind the Design: A Day in the Life of a Garden Architect</h2>
        <img src="images/garden-architect.png" alt="Garden Architect">
        <p>Every morning, Lucky Shrub’s lead designer, Jason, walks through active client sites, sketchpad in hand. He studies light angles, takes note of slopes and soil types, and starts to imagine how each space can come alive. His designs aren’t cookie-cutter — they’re custom blueprints that reflect the client’s lifestyle and the land’s natural rhythm.</p>
        <p>Balancing artistry with practicality, Jason layers texture, shape, and movement into each project. Trees become anchors, pathways shape flow, and plant choices tell a story. To Jason, every yard is a canvas, and every design is a chance to transform a blank space into a living sanctuary that feels both intentional and alive.</p>

        <h2>5 Low-Maintenance Plants That Thrive in Arizona Heat</h2>
        <img src="images/low-maintenance.png" alt="Low-Maintenance Plants">
        <p>Not all plants can take the desert sun—but these can! Succulents like agave and echeveria thrive in full sun with minimal watering, storing moisture in their thick leaves to survive the hottest months. Lantana, with its bright, multi-colored blooms, and desert marigold, known for its golden flowers and resilience, are both colorful additions that attract pollinators without demanding much care. And let’s not forget rosemary—a fragrant, evergreen shrub that’s as tough as it is beautiful.</p>
        <p>These plants don’t just survive in the Arizona climate—they flourish in it. Whether you’re planting a new bed or refreshing a tired space, these choices bring lasting beauty with little effort. Perfect for busy homeowners or those new to gardening, they keep your yard vibrant and drought-tolerant year-round.</p>

        <img src="images/landscaping.png" alt="Landscaping">
        <p>A well-designed landscape does more than beautify—it increases your home’s value, reduces energy costs, and creates an inviting space for connection and relaxation. Strategic plant placement can naturally cool your home, while thoughtful design turns your yard into a personal retreat. At Lucky Shrub, we craft outdoor spaces that grow in value and meaning, making your investment one that pays off in more ways than one.</p>
